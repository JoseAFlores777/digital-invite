# Tasks: LIVE-ROUTE

1. Review development standards at ./junie/development-standards.md and align approach. [blocked]
   - File not found; proceed with existing project conventions (Next.js app dir, React/TS, Tailwind). Requires maintainer validation.
2. Identify required components (Hero, Countdown, Gift, Gallery, Footer) and verify presence. [done]
3. Create Next.js route at `src/app/live/page.tsx` composing the components in order. [done]
4. Ensure compatibility with client components and existing styling tokens. [done]
5. Build project to verify compilation and route creation. [pending]
6. Manual smoke test: navigate to /live and verify sections render in the specified order. [pending]

Notes:
- Minimal change; no backend or API updates.
- Reuses existing components and styles for consistency.
